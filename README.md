    Getting started postgresql in local not vagrant
   To install PostgreSQL on the command line we will be using a package manager called Homebrew.You can start by copying and pasting the following command into our command line: 
```
   /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Installing Postgres
```
brew install postgresql
```
Homebrew takes care of resolving Postgresâ€™ dependencies. You can just start postgres with the following command.
```
brew services start postgresql
```
And, make sure postgres is installed and running by checking what version is running
```
postgres -V
```
Create user in CLI
```
createuser {username} -s
